#### Abstract
Inferring liquid properties from vision is a challenging task due to the complex nature of fluids,
both in behavior and detection. Nevertheless, the ability to infer their properties directly from
visual information is highly valuable for autonomous fluid handling systems, as cameras are readily
available. Moreover, predicting fluid properties purely from vision can accelerate the process of
fluid characterization saving considerable time and effort in various experimental environments. In
this work, we present a purely vision-based approach to estimate viscosity, leveraging the fact that
the behavior of the fluid oscillations is directly related to the viscosity. Specifically, we utilize a
3D convolutional autoencoder to learn latent representations of different fluid-oscillating patterns
present in videos. We leverage this latent representation to visually infer the category of fluid or the
dynamics viscosity of fluid from video.
